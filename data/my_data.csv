I had brought him some beers a few weeks earlier in Decorah  and he wanted to thank me by giving me a bottle and a growler of red label Assassin:).  As we were standing there talking Omar came up and introduced himself. Clark was totally bombed but was absolutely thrilled to meet him. The first thing he said was that Omar was his inspiration, that he started his brewery (TG) to try to do something amazing like Surly had done.  Clark was too busy (sweetly:) fawning to notice that Omar wanted some beer, so I poured him some Zeelander and Sue.  We all chatted for several minutes and then Omar invited Clark for a late night tour of the brewery. Clark turned to me and said, ""Watch my stuff!""  So for the next hour and a half two friends and I were hosts of all the TG brews, pouring them for whomever came by (and warding people off from the four bottles of red label assassin in the pile but everyone kept ogling).
